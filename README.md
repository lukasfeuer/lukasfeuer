Hi, I'm [Lukas Feuer](https://github.com/lukasfeuer/lukasfeuer),

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Psychologist (M.Sc.)** based in Germany.

I mostly work with R and in the context of Shiny and Markdown I am also familiar with HTML and CSS. In addition I'm also very interested in Julia and Python and hope to work more with these languages in the future. 

My interests right now focus more on statistic methodology rather than a specific research context. I am currently learning bayesian statistics and machine learning techniques.
