Hi, I'm [Lukas Feuer](https://github.com/lukasfeuer/lukasfeuer),

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Psychologist (M.Sc.)** based in Germany.

I mostly work with R and in the context of Shiny and Markdown I am also familiar with HTML and CSS. I am also very interested in Julia and hope to work more with this language in the future. 

My interests right now focus more on statistics and methods than a specific research context. I am currently learning bayesian statistics and machine learning techniques.
